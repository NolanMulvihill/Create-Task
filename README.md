# Create-Task
This was the code I submitted for my Create Task in AP CS P

This code was created is CodeHS using Brython.

This code creates two games:

One is a Higher or Lower game that has you randomly compare two random champions from League of Legends based on age height or weight.

The second game is a Guess that Champion, based off of whose that Pokemon, where you are given a silloute of a character and have to guess who it is with the help of four multiple choice options. The way a multiple choice answer is selected is by going through the number 1-4 and each correlate to a multiple choice option
